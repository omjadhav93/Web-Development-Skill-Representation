# JavaScript Skills Showcase

Welcome to my JavaScript skills repository! This collection features various examples demonstrating my proficiency in JavaScript across different domains. Each subfolder contains examples of specific topics, showcasing how I utilize JavaScript to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.

## Folder Structure

- **Asynchronous Programming**
  - Demonstrates how I handle asynchronous operations using `async/await` and event dispatching.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`waiting_for_dispatchEvent.js`](./waiting_for_dispatchEvent.js): Handling state selection and dynamic district options.
    - [`waiting_for_server_response.js`](./waiting_for_server_response.js): Fetching orders using asynchronous requests.

- **DOM Manipulation And Event Handling**
  - Highlights how I manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and manage user interactions.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`detect_click_outside_div.js`](./detect_click_outside_div.js): Managing dropdown options and closing them upon outside clicks.
    - [`dynamic_brand_management_form.js`](./dynamic_brand_management_form.js): Creating dynamic forms for adding and editing brand details.

- **Dynamic UI Interactions**
  - Illustrates how I enhance user interfaces with interactive elements.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`Seller_Image_Upload_UI_With_Color_Selection.js`](./Seller_Image_Upload_UI_With_Color_Selection.js): Designing an image upload interface with color selection for sellers.
    - [`running_counter_effect.js`](./running_counter_effect.js): Implementing a running counter effect to showcase achievements dynamically.

- **Form Validation**
  - Covers my approach to ensuring data integrity and user input validation in forms.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`image_file_type_validation.js`](./image_file_type_validation.js): Validating image file types before upload.
    - [`live_image_preview_on_upload.js`](./ive_image_preview_on_upload.js): Previewing images upon selection.
    - [`manual_form_validation_submit_control.js`](./manual_form_validation_submit_control.js): Managing form validation manually before submission.

- **Integration with APIs**
  - Demonstrates how I interact with APIs to fetch and manipulate data.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`lazy_loading_products.js`](./lazy_loading_products.js): Implementing lazy loading for product sections.
    - [`like_products_with_api.js`](./like_products_with_api.js): Managing product likes/dislikes through API calls.

- **Optimization Techniques**
  - Showcases how I optimize performance and improve loading times in applications.
  - **Examples**:
    - [`running_counter_effect.js`](./running_counter_effect.js): Optimizing the product section with lazy loading.
